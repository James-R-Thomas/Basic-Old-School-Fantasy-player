Acrobats are trained in skills of balance, gymnastics, and stealth. They often work in conjunction with thieves and may belong to a Thieves’ Guild.

Adjust ability scores: During character creation, acrobats may not lower STR.

Encumbrance: Evasion, falling, jumping, and tightrope walking cannot be performed if encumbrance reduces the acrobat’s movement rate to less than 90’ (30’) (see [[Time, Weight, Movement#Encumbrance (Optional Rule)|Encumbrance]]).

## Acrobat Skills

Acrobats can use the following skills with the chance of success shown opposite.

> Climb sheer surfaces (CS): A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the acrobat falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.

> Falling (FA): When able to tumble, acrobats suffer no damage from the first 10’ of any fall. Damage due to falling from a greater height is reduced by the listed percentage (rounding fractions down).

> Hide in shadows (HS): The acrobat must be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.

> Move silently (MS): An acrobat may attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.

> Tightrope walking (TW): Acrobats can walk along tightropes, narrow beams, and ledges at up to half their normal movement rate. A roll is required every 60’. Failure indicates that the acrobat falls and suffers falling damage. Windy conditions may reduce the chance of success by up to 20%. Holding a balance pole increases the chance of success by 10%.

## Combat   

Acrobats cannot wear armor bulkier than leather and cannot use shields. They are able to use all missile weapons. Their use of melee weapons is restricted to light blades and staff weapons.

## Evasion   

When retreating from melee, an acrobat’s ability to tumble negates the opponent’s usual +2 bonus to hit

## Jumping

With a 20’ run-up, an acrobat can jump across a 10’ wide pit or chasm (or 20’ wide when aided by the use of a pole). Also, when using a pole, an acrobat can jump over a 10’ high wall or onto a 10’ high ledge. Suitable poles for jumping include: 10’ poles, pole arms, spears, staves.

## Tumbling Attack

Using the falling or jumping abilities, an acrobat can make a tumbling melee attack. The attack inflicts double damage if successful. Against an unaware opponent, the acrobat also gains a +4 bonus to hit.

## Ability Adjustments                       

Each Acrobat skill is governed by their dexterity ability score  Add to each Acrobat ability the relevant score modifier times five (i.e. +1 gives +5%, +2 gives +10%, and so on).

## Absolute Limit of Ability

The rules for ability adjustments detail various adjustments to Acrobat abilities.  However, regardless of any adjustments, no Acrobat ability may be higher than 99%.
