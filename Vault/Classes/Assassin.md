Assassins are adventurers who specialize in the arts of infiltration and killing by stealth. They sometimes form guilds, whereby their illicit services may be hired.

Alignment: Assassins may not be lawful.

Adjust ability scores: During character creation, assassins may not lower STR.

## Assassin Skills

Assassins can use the following skills with the chance of success shown opposite:

> Assassination (AS): When attacking an unaware humanoid from behind, an assassin gains a +4 bonus to hit. If the attack succeeds, the victim must save versus death with a penalty dependent on the assassin’s level (noted in the table opposite). If the save fails, the victim is instantly killed, otherwise the assassin’s attack inflicts normal damage.

> Climb sheer surfaces (CS): A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the assassin falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.

> Hear noise (HN): In a quiet environment (e.g. not in combat), an assassin may attempt to listen at a door or to hear the sounds of something (e.g. a wandering monster) approaching.

> Hide in shadows (HS): Requires the assassin to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.

> Move silently (MS): An assassin may attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.

## Combat   

Assassins cannot wear armor bulkier than leather but may use shields. They can use all types of weapons.

## Disguise 

Characters of any class may don disguises, but assassins are masters of the art— able to create disguises that pass even close scrutiny.

Chance of detection: Everyone the assassin meets has a 2% chance of spotting the disguise. This roll is repeated once every subsequent day of meeting.

Posing as another class, race, or sex: Increases the chance of being detected by 2% per change.

Height and weight: A disguise may alter height (up to 3” shorter or 5” taller) or weight (slightly thinner, much bulkier).

## Hirelings

Assassins of 1st-3rd level may not employ retainers, mercenaries, or specialists. From 4th level, an assassin may hire other assassins of lower level. From 8th level, an assassin may hire thieves, and from 12th level any type of character.

## Poison

Victims of a poisoning by an assassin (see Poison) suffer a -2 penalty to the saving throw.

## After Reaching 12th Level

An assassin may attempt to take over an existing guild of assassins or thieves by killing the old guild-master. This may be achieved by any means (e.g. poisoning, assassination, duel). If successful, the character can maintain a guild of 7d6 members. 75% of the existing members will leave, but new members (typically 1st level assassins) will arrive over time.

## Ability Adjustments            

Each Assassin skill other than Assassination is governed by an ability score  Add to each Assassin skill the relevant score modifier times five (i.e. -1 gives -5%, +2 gives +10%, and so on).

- Climb Sheer Surfaces—Strength
- Hear Noise—Wisdom
- Hide in Shadows—Intelligence
- Move Silently—Dexterity

## Absolute Limit of Ability

The rules for ability adjustments detail various adjustments to Acrobat abilities.  However, regardless of any adjustments, no Assassin ability may be higher than 99%.
