Barbarians are tribal warriors from wild lands. They are formidable fighters with many useful survival skills but have a deep mistrust of the arcane.

Prime requisites: A barbarian with at least 13 in one prime requisite gains a 5% bonus to experience. If both STR and CON are 16 or higher, the barbarian gets a +10% bonus.

Literacy: A 1st level barbarian cannot read or write, irrespective of INT score.

#### Agile Fighting

Upon reaching 4th level, a barbarian gains a +1 AC bonus. This increases to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 8th level, and +4 at 10th level.

#### Alertness

Only a Thief one or more levels higher than the Barbarian can use their Backstab ability on the Barbarian.

#### Animal reflexes

The Barbarian can be surprised only on a roll of 1 on 1d6.

#### Combat

Barbarians can use all types of weapons and can use leather armor, chainmail, and shields.

#### Hunter

In the wilderness Barbarians can surprise enemies on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6.

#### Cure Poison 

In the wilderness, a barbarian can gather herbs to concoct an antidote to natural poisons. This takes one turn per character to be cured. Each subject may make a second save versus poison to end the effects.

#### Fear of Magic          

Barbarians are mistrustful of magic and will refuse to knowingly use or come under the influence of spells or magic items. Barbarians will accept divine magic associated with their tribal religion.

#### Foraging and Hunting

A party with a barbarian succeeds at foraging with a 2-in-6 chance and finds prey when hunting with a 5-in-6 chance (see Wilderness Adventuring).

#### Strike Invulnerable Monsters

A barbarian of 4th level or higher is able to hit monsters that can normally only be harmed by magic.

#### Runner

The Barbarian adds 5 feet to their tactical movement.

## Barbarian Skills     

In the wilderness, barbarians can use the following skills with the chance of success shown opposite:

> Climb sheer surfaces (CS): Only applies to natural surfaces (e.g. tree trunks, cliff faces). A skill roll is required for each 100’ height to be climbed. Failure indicates that the barbarian falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.

> Hide in undergrowth (HD): Requires the barbarian to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.

> Move silently (MS): A barbarian may attempt to sneak past enemies.

##### Rolling Skill Checks                   

All skills are rolled on d%, with a result of less than or equal to the listed percentage indicating success.

##### Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hiding and moving silently on the player’s behalf, as the barbarian always believes the attempt to be successful. If the roll fails, the referee knows that the barbarian has been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

## Rage                

Once per day a Barbarian can fly into a Rage, which will last ten rounds.  While raging, a Barbarian cannot use any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can they activate magic items of any kind (including potions).  Of course, magic items with a continuous effect (like a Ring of Protection) continue to function.

While raging, the Barbarian must charge directly into combat with the nearest recognizable enemy.  If no enemy is nearby, the Barbarian must end their rage (see below) or else attack the nearest character.

While raging, the character temporarily gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws versus mind-altering spells, but suffers a penalty of -2 to armor class.

The Barbarian may prematurely end their rage with a successful save vs. Spells.

At the end of the rage, the Barbarian loses the rage modifiers and becomes fatigued, suffering a penalty of -2 to attack rolls, damage, armor class, and saving throws.  While fatigued, the Barbarian may not charge nor move at a running rate.  This state of fatigue lasts for an hour.

A Barbarian may use this ability up to two times per day at 6th level and three times per day at 12th level.

## Combat Talents           

Select one of the following combat talents at 1st, 3th, and 6th Levels

1. Cleave: When in melee with multiple foes, if the fighter strikes a killing blow, they may immediately make another attack against a second foe. The second attack roll is penalized at –2 to attack.

2. Defender: When the fighter is in melee with a foe, any attacks the foe makes at characters other than the fighter are penalized at –2 to attack.

3. Leader: Mercenaries or retainers under the fighter’s command and within 60’ gain a +1 bonus to morale/loyalty. All the fighter’s allies within 60’ gain a +1 bonus to saves against fear effects.

4. Main gauche: When fighting with a dagger in the off hand (in place of a shield), the fighter may choose each combat round to gain a +1 bonus to AC or to attack rolls.

5. Slayer: The fighter gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls when in combat with foes of a specific type. The type of enemy must be chosen when this talent is selected. (Examples: undead, clerics, dragons, giants, etc.)

## After Reaching 8th Level             

A barbarian can call upon their native people to form a great horde of warriors, numbering 250 per level above 7th. The warriors are 1st level fighters with basic combat gear and may be mounted if customary in their culture. A horde can only be mustered for a specific purpose (e.g. attacking an enemy city, rescuing hostages, etc.). Once the purpose is achieved or abandoned, the horde disbands. Mustering a horde takes one week, and it remains for one week per level of the barbarian.
