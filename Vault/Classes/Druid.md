Druids are priests of nature, protecting wild lands from the encroachment of “civilized” Law and the corrupting touch of Chaos. They worship the force of nature itself, personified in the form of various nature deities.

Alignment: Druids regard the ways of the natural world as the ideal state of things. They see the concepts of Law and Chaos as extremes that are both equally against nature. Thus, druids must be neutral in alignment.

## Charm Immunity

Druids of 7th level and above are immune to the charms of fairies and Sylvan creatures (e.g. dryads, nixies).

## Combat

The holy doctrine of the druids stipulates that they may not use metal armor or shields (wooden shields may be purchased at the normal price). Their choice of weapons is limited to clubs, daggers, slings, spears, and staves.

## Divine Magic

See [[Rules of  Magic]], for full details on divine magic.

Holy symbol: A druid must carry a holy symbol: a sprig of mistletoe which the character must harvest. (see the [[Adventuring Gear#^fbac21|Holy Symbol]] in [[Adventuring Gear]])

Deity disfavor: Druids must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment and religion. Druids who fall from favor with their deity may incur penalties.

Magical research: A druid of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to create new spells or other magical effects associated with their deity. When a druid reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items.

Spell casting: A druid may pray to receive spells from nature. The power and number of spells available to a druid are determined by the character’s experience level.

Using magic items: As spell casters, druids can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by divine spell casters (e.g. some staves). Druids may not use magical books or tomes.

## Energy Resistance

Druids gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against electricity (lightning) and fire.

## Identiﬁcation

Druids can identify all plants and animals and can discern pure water.

## Languages

Druids speak a secret tongue known only to their sect. At each level above 2nd,

a druid also learns to speak a language used by creatures of Sylvan forests (e.g. dryads, green dragons, pixies, treants).

## Pass Without Trace

From 3rd level, a druid can pass through natural environments without leaving any tracks. The character is also able to move through overgrown areas at normal speed and without impediment.

## Path-Finding     

A party with a druid has only a 1-in-6 chance of getting lost in woodlands. See Wilderness Adventuring.

## Shape Change   

At 7th level, a druid gains the power to change into the form of a reptile, bird, and mammal (once per day each). The animal may be of any size up to around twice the bulk of the druid’s normal form. If a druid has lost hit points, they regain 1d4 hit points per level upon changing into an animal. All equipment carried by the druid is absorbed into the animal form and reappears when the druid changes back.

## Reaching 15th Level and Above            

There can only be nine druids of 15th level. When a druid has enough experience to reach 15th level, they must challenge an existing 15th level druid. The character only advances to 15th level if the other druid is defeated. Such challenges may take any form that is agreed by both parties, including combat (which need not be fatal). Likewise, there can only be three druids of 17th level and a single druid (known as the arch-druid) of 20th level.

Druids who attain 15th level or above may build a stronghold integrated into a natural setting.
