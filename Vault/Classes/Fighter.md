Fighters are adventurers trained in warfare and combat. In a group of adventurers, the role of fighters is to battle monsters and defend other characters.
## Weapon Specialization               

The  player of a Fighter may choose a weapon in which the character is especially skilled. Specialization only applies to "true" Fighters, and not to any subclasses.

**At first level:** the player applies two ranks of specialization in separate categories (both can not be applied to the same weapon type). This choices must be quite specific; for instance, a specialization in the longsword will give no bonuses when using a short sword.

**Every third level after first:** (that is, 4th, 7th, 10th, etc.) the player applies another rank of specialization. Each new rank may be applied to an existing specialization, or to a new specialization.

For instance, at first level a player assigns a rank to longsword. He gains a bonus of +1 on attack rolls when using a longsword. At 4th level, the player may assign the new rank to longsword, giving a bonus of +1 on attack rolls and +1 on damage; or, the rank may be applied to a new weapon, such as the longbow, in which case both weapons have +1 on attack rolls but no bonus to damage.

As indicated in the Attacks Per Round column, at higher ranks of specialization the Fighter is allowed to attack more than one time per round. 3/2 means that the character may attack three time in every two rounds, once in the odd-numbered round and twice in the even-numbered round. At 2/1 the Fighter is allowed to attack with the specialized weapon two times per round.

**Additional attacks:** always come after all other attacks are resolved; that is, the Fighter attacks once on their Initiative number, then again after all “first” attacks are done. If more than one weapon specialist is involved in  a battle, count Initiative down twice, once for “first” attacks and again for “second” attacks.

### Shield Specialist

A Fighter character may spend a specialization rank to specialize with shields.

A shield specialist receives an additional +1 bonus to AC while wielding the shield.

### Armor Specialist

A Fighter character may spend a specialization rank to consider a type of armor of their choice one step lighter in regards of movement rates and stealth.

A Fighter can only apply one rank of specialization to each type of armor.

### Defensive Specialist

A Fighter character may spend a specialization rank to specialize in defense.

The player must declare that the fighter is defending. This can be done regardless of Initiative, and must declare who they are defending. The defending character can give all or part of the AC bonus gained from this specialty to another character within melee range .

The defending character applies a bonus of +4 to AC. If the character is holding/using a specialized weapon, they may add the specialization "to hit" bonus to AC to reflect the additional parrying skill. Also, magic weapons usually confer the bonus to the AC of the defending character (as described under Two-Weapon Combat).

The fighter can’t make attacks for the round in which they are defending. This specialization is especially effective if the fighter is surprised.

## Combat

Fighters can use all types of weapons and armor.

## Stronghold

Any time a fighter wishes (and has sufficient money), they can build a castle or stronghold and control the surrounding lands.

## Two Weapon Combat         

Fighters can use a weapon in each hand. The weapon in the primary hand suffers a penalty of -2 to hit, while the weapon in the off-hand is used at a -5 penalty normally. Subtract from this penalty the character's Dexterity bonus, with a minimum penalty of +0 (so a character with 18 Dexterity does not get a +1 bonus to hit this way). The primary weapon must, obviously, be one-handed, and the secondary must be a dagger, hand axe, or similar very small weapon.

The off-handed weapon normally does not get multiple attacks, even if allowed by specialization. Like a monster using an attack routine (claw-claw-bite) the off-handed weapon attacks at the same time as the primary weapon.

Note: Off-handed weapon attacks (with no primary hand attack) are at -3 penalty, with the Dexterity bonus subtracted as above.

As an option, a character using two-weapon combat may choose to use the off-handed weapon as a defensive item similar to a shield. This must be declared at the start of the round.

## Combat Talents           

Select one of the following combat talents at 1st, 3th, and 6th Levels

1. Cleave: When in melee with multiple foes, if the fighter strikes a killing blow, they may immediately make another attack against a second foe. The second attack roll is penalized at –2 to attack.

2. Defender: When the fighter is in melee with a foe, any attacks the foe makes at characters other than the fighter are penalized at –2 to attack.

3. Leader: Mercenaries or retainers under the fighter’s command and within 60’ gain a +1 bonus to morale/loyalty. All the fighter’s allies within 60’ gain a +1 bonus to saves against fear effects.

4. Main gauche: When fighting with a dagger in the off hand (in place of a shield), the fighter may choose each combat round to gain a +1 bonus to AC or to attack rolls.

5. Slayer: The fighter gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls when in combat with foes of a specific type. The type of enemy must be chosen when this talent is selected. (Examples: undead, clerics, dragons, giants, etc.)

## After Reaching 9th Level

A fighter may be granted a title such as Baron or Baroness. The land under the fighter’s control is then known as a Barony.
