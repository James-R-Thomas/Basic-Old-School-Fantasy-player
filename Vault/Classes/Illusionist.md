## Arcane Magic  

Magical research: An illusionist of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When an illusionist reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items. Researched spells, effects, and magic items must be within the scope of the illusionist class, as judged by the referee.

Spell casting: Illusionists carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The [[Illusionist#Illusionist Level Progression|level progression table]] shows both the number of spells in the illusionist’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st level illusionist has two spells in their spell book (see [[Illusionist Spell List]]), selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose).

Using magic items: As spell casters, illusionists are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands). They are, however, not able to use magic items with effects that cause direct damage (e.g. a wand that shoots fireballs).

## Combat

Illusionists can only use daggers and are unable to use shields or wear any kind of armor. This makes them very vulnerable in combat.

Illusionists and Staves: illusionists are allowed to wield a staff in combat.

## After Reaching 11th Level

An illusionist may build a stronghold, often a great tower. 1d6 apprentices of levels 1–3 will then arrive to study under the illusionist.

## Bonus Spells                  

Illusionist gain bonus spells for high Intelligence. This allows the character to prepare more spells of certain levels than usual. Characters may not prepare spells above the level they can cast, so even though a character with an 18 intelligence gets a second level spell as a bonus spell, he or she can't prepare second level spells until reaching third level.
