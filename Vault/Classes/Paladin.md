Paladins are warriors sworn by sacred oath to the service of a Lawful holy order. Alignment: A paladin must be lawful.

If the character’s alignment ever changes (for any reason), they lose all class abilities and become a fighter of the same level. The referee may allow the character to perform a quest of atonement in order to regain their status as a paladin.

Prime requisites: A paladin with at least 13 in one prime requisite gets +5% to experience. If both STR and WIS are 16 or higher, the paladin gets a +10% bonus.

## Combat

Paladins can use all types of weapons and armor.

## Divine Magic

See [[Rules of  Magic#Divine Magic|Devine Magic]], for full details on divine magic.

Holy symbol: A paladin must carry a holy symbol (see the [[Adventuring Gear#^fbac21|Holy Symbol]] in [[Adventuring Gear]]).

Deity disfavor: Paladins must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment and religion. Paladins who fall from favor with their deity may incur penalties.

Spell casting: From 9th level, a paladin may pray to receive spells. The power and number of spells available to a paladin are determined by the character’s experience level (Paladins have the same spell selection as clerics).

## Holy Resistance     

Paladins are immune to all disease.

## Laying on Hands     

Once per day, a paladin can heal 2 hit points per level by laying their hands on wounded characters. Additionally, a paladin of 5th level or higher may cure disease once per week by laying on hands.

## Vow of Humility

A paladin may keep only a total of one suit of magical armor, one magical shield, and one magical melee weapon. They must also donate 10% of all income to a Lawful religious institution.

## Warhorse

A paladin of 4th level or higher may summon a holy charger—a warhorse with AC 5 [14], 5+5 HD, and a movement rate of 180’ (60’). If the horse dies, another may not be summoned for 10 years.

## After Reaching 9th Level

With the permission of their holy order, a paladin can build a castle or stronghold and control the surrounding lands. The paladin may be granted a title such as Baron or Baroness. The land under their control is then known as a Barony.

## Two Weapon Combat    

Paladin can use a weapon in each hand. The weapon in the primary hand suffers a penalty of -2 to hit, while the weapon in the off-hand is used at a -5 penalty normally. Subtract from this penalty the character's Dexterity bonus, with a minimum penalty of +0 (so a character with 18 Dexterity does not get a +1 bonus to hit this way). The primary weapon must, obviously, be one-handed, and the secondary must be a dagger, hand axe, or similar very small weapon.

The off-handed weapon normally does not get multiple attacks, even if allowed by specialization. Like a monster using an attack routine (claw-claw-bite) the off-handed weapon attacks at the same time as the primary weapon.

Note: Off-handed weapon attacks (with no primary hand attack) are at -3 penalty, with the Dexterity bonus subtracted as above.

As an option, a character using two-weapon combat may choose to use the off-handed weapon as a defensive item similar to a shield. This must be declared at the start of the round.

## Combat Talents  

Select one of the following combat talents at 1st, 3th, and 6th Levels

1. Cleave: When in melee with multiple foes, if the paladin strikes a killing blow, they may immediately make another attack against a second foe. The second attack roll is penalized at –2 to attack.

2. Defender: When the paladin is in melee with a foe, any attacks the foe makes at characters other than the paladin are penalized at –2 to attack.

3. Leader: Mercenaries or retainers under the paladin’s command and within 60’ gain a +1 bonus to morale/loyalty. All the paladin’s allies within 60’ gain a +1 bonus to saves against fear effects.

4. Main gauche: When fighting with a dagger in the off hand (in place of a shield), the paladin may choose each combat round to gain a +1 bonus to AC or to attack rolls.

5. Slayer: The paladin gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls when in combat with foes of a specific type. The type of enemy must be chosen when this talent is selected. (Examples: undead, clerics, dragons, giants, etc.)

## Turning the Undead  

Paladins of 3rd level and higher can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters encountered. To turn the undead, the player rolls 1d20. The referee then consults the table opposite, comparing the roll against the HD of the type of undead monsters targeted.

### Successful Turning

If the turning attempt succeeds, the player must roll 2d6 again to determine the number of HD affected (turned or destroyed).

Turned undead: Will leave the area, if possible, and will not harm or make contact with the paladin.

Destroyed undead: Are instantly and permanently annihilated.

Excess HD and minimum effect: Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a monster are wasted. However, at least one undead monster will always be affected on a successful turning.

Mixed groups: If turn undead is used against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.

## Turning Table Results           

No: The turning fails.
Number: If the 1d20 turning roll is higher or equal, the turning attempt succeeds.
T: The turning succeeds.
D: The turning succeeds; the monsters are destroyed, not simply caused to flee.
