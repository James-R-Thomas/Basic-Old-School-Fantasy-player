Rangers are members of a secret society which protects their native lands from invasion and the influence of Chaos. They are skilled warriors who are adapted to life in the wilds. At higher levels, their connection with nature grants them the ability to cast spells.

Alignment: As protectors, rangers may only be lawful or neutral. If a ranger ever changes alignment to chaotic, they lose all special class abilities and become a fighter of the same level, with no weapon specialization. The character may be able to regain their ranger status by performing a special quest.

## Awareness

Rangers are only surprised on a roll of 1. This may mean that a ranger is able to act in the surprise round while their companions are surprised.

## Combat

Rangers can use all types of weapons and can use leather armor, chainmail, and shields. Because of their need for stealth, they cannot use plate mail.

## Divine Magic

See [[Rules of  Magic#Divine Magic|Devine Magic]], for full details on divine magic.

Spell casting: From 8th level, due to a deep connection with nature, a ranger gains the ability to cast spells. The power and number of spells available to a ranger are determined by the character’s experience level. (rangers use the druid spell list).

## Foraging and Hunting      

A party with a ranger succeeds at foraging with a 2-in-6 chance and finds prey when hunting with a 5-in-6 chance (see [[Wilderness Adventuring]] )

## Limited Possessions 

A ranger may only keep wealth and possessions that can be kept on their person or mount. Excess must be donated to worthy causes (not other PCs!).

## Pursuit

When the ranger’s party pursues an opposing group in the wilderness (see [[Evasion and Pursuit]]), the chance of evasion is reduced by 10%.

## Special Abilities

Absolute Limit of Ability

The rules which follow detail various adjustments to Ranger abilities.  However, regardless of any adjustments, no Ranger ability may be higher than 99%.

Effects of Armor on Stealth

Wearing no armor imparts a 10% bonus

Wearing leather imparts no bonus or penalty

Wearing chain imparts a 20% penalty

Wearing a shield imparts 10% penalty (cumulative with other penalties above).

Ability Bonus or Penalty Adjustments

Each Ranger ability is governed by an ability score (as given below).  Add to each Ranger ability the relevant ability score modifier times five (i.e. +1 gives +5%, +2 gives +10%, and so on).

The dominant ability scores for Ranger abilities are as follows:

### Ranger Abilities

| Abilities     | Ability Score |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Move Silently | Dexterity     |
| Hide          | Intelligence  |
| Track         | Wisdom        |
|               |               |

## Tracking 

Rangers can identify and follow tracks. This skill improves as the character gains levels Success may be modified by the following factors:

- Soft/hard ground: +20% to –50%.

- Size of group being tracked: +2% per creature beyond the first.

 - Passing through an area where other tracks mingle: –50%.

- Age of tracks: –5% per 12 hours.

- Rainfall: –25% per hour.

- Efforts made to hide tracks: –25%.

## After Reaching 10th Level  

2d12 beings will join the ranger as followers. The nature of these followers is up to the referee—they may include human or demihuman adventurers, animals, fantastic mounts, sylvan creatures, or special monsters. If any of the followers die, they are not replaced.
