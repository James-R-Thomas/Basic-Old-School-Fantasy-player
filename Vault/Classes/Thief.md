Thieves are adventurers who live by their skills of deception and stealth. They have a range of specialized adventuring skills unavailable to other characters. However, thieves are only sometimes to be trusted.

**Adjust ability scores:** In step 3 of character creation, thieves may not lower STR.

## Back-stab

When attacking an unaware opponent from behind, a thief receives a +4 bonus to hit and doubles any damage dealt.

## Combat

Valuing stealth above all, thieves can only wear leather armor and cannot use shields. They can use any weapon.

## Read Languages

A 4th level or higher thief can read non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 80% probability. If the roll fails, the thief may not try to reread the same text before gaining an experience level.

## Scroll Use

A thief of 10th level or higher can cast arcane spells from scrolls. There is a 10% chance of error: an unusual or deleterious effect is created instead of the expected effect.

## Thief Skills

Thieves can use the following skills, with the chance of success shown below:

##### Climb sheer surfaces (CS)
Thieves have the skill to climb sheer surfaces (i.e. vertical or very steep surfaces with only minimal handholds) without special equipment.
> A roll is required for each 100’ climb. If the roll fails, the thief falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage. 

   **Easier circumstances:** Thieves can climb non-sheer surfaces without a roll.
   **Other characters:** May require a DEX check when climbing in a difficult or tense situation. Non-thieves cannot climb sheer surfaces without special equipment.
##### Find or remove treasure traps (TR)
Thieves’ expertise with small, complex mechanisms allows them to find and remove treasure traps.
> A roll is required to find a treasure trap and then another to remove it. This may be attempted only once per trap.

**Room traps:** Thieves have the standard 1-in-6 chance of finding room traps (see [[Dungeon Adventuring#Searching|Searching]]).

**Other characters:** Do not have the expertise to attempt this feat.

**Descriptive handling of traps:** PCs of all classes may try to find or remove traps of all kinds by describing their actions (e.g. poking a dagger in a lock, pouring water over a floor, etc.). In this way, it may be possible to find, bypass, or disable traps without a roll. The referee should adjudicate the effects of such actions based on the mechanisms of any traps present.
##### Hear noise (HN)
In a quiet environment (e.g., not in combat, a thief may attempt to listen at the door or to hear the sounds of something (e.g., a wandering monster approaching.

> All characters can attempt to hear noises (see [[Dungeon Adventuring#Doors|Doors]]). Thieves’ chance of success increases with expertise points.
##### Hide in shadows (HS)
Thieves have the skill to hide in shadows (i.e. when no other cover is available).
> Requires the thief to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is impossible.

**Easier circumstances:** Thieves can hidebehind decent cover without a roll.

**Halflings and gnomes:** Characters of these classes have a similar hiding ability to thieves which may be adjudicated using the same guidelines.

**Other characters:** May be required to roll (e.g. a DEX check or 2-in-6 chance) to successfully hide behind cover. Non-thieves have no chance of hiding if the only cover available is shadows.
##### Move silently (MS) 
Thieves have the skill to move silently (i.e. making absolutely no sound whatsoever), giving them the ability to sneak past enemies unnoticed.

**Silent environments:** Moving silently is required to sneak unnoticed in a completely silent environment. e.g. if a guard is standing quietly listening for intruders, a roll to move silently may be required.

**Noisy environments:** Thieves can sneak unnoticed without a roll in environments with background noise (i.e. where moving absolutely silently is unnecessary). This includes combat.

**Failed rolls:** A thief who fails their roll to move silently is still assumed to be moving quietly, thus the normal surprise rules apply (see notes on surprise below).

**Other characters:** When exploring (i.e. not in combat or fleeing), it is assumed that characters are attempting to move around quietly. In environments with some level of background noise, the surprise roll (see notes on surprise below) covers characters’ chance of sneaking unnoticed. Non-thieves cannot sneak unnoticed in silent environments.

**Surprise:** If PCs’ presence is not otherwise obvious (e.g. due to light sources or noisy actions), the standard surprise roll covers the chance of characters sneaking  unnoticed in a non-silent environment. See [[Encounters]] .

##### Open locks (OL)
Thieves’ expertise with small, complex mechanisms allows them to pick locks.
- Requires thieves’ tools (see [[Adventuring Gear]]). 

> A thief can only try this skill once per lock. If the roll fails, the thief may not try the same lock again before gaining an experience level.

 **Other characters:** Do not have the expertise to attempt this feat.
##### Pick pockets (PP)
Thieves are trained in the subtle art of picking pockets. 
**Other characters:** Do not have the expertise to attempt this feat.

> If the victim is above 5th level, the thief’s roll is penalized by 1-in-12 for every level above 5th. There is always at least a 1-in-12 chance of failure or success. A roll of more than the expertise level by the attempted theft is noticed. The referee should determine the victim's reaction (possibly using the reaction table under ***[[Encounters]]***.

## Expertise

- **Base chance of success:** All skills begin with a 2-in-12 chance of success.

- **Expertise points:** Thieves gain expertise points to improve their chance of success with their skills. Each point allocated to a skill improves the chance of success by 1-in-12. Multiple points may be allocated to a skill, further increasing the chance of success. For example, if 2 points are allocated to a skill, the chance of success is raised to 4-in-12 (from the base 2-in-12 chance of success).

- **At 1st level:** At character creation, a thief has 8 expertise points to allocate.

- **Gaining levels:** A thief gains 4 additional expertise points to allocate.

- **Maximum chance of success:** No skill may be raised above 11-in-12.

## Rolling Skill Checks

**Skill Checks:** It is rolled on 1d12. The skill succeeds if the roll under the listed expertise level of that skill.

##### Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hear noise, hide in shadows, and move silently on the player’s behalf, as the thief does not immediately know if the attempt was successful. If a hide in shadows or move silently roll fails, the referee knows that the thief has been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

## After Reaching 9th Level

A thief may construct a secret hideout, attracting 2d6 apprentice thieves of 1st level. Apprentices are usually loyal to the character but are not automatically replaced if killed. The character may use their apprentices as the beginnings of a Thieves’ Guild.
