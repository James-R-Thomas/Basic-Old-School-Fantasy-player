## Alarm                          

Duration: 2 hours/level

Range:    20’+10’/level

Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time any creature larger than a rat enters the warded area or touches it.  A creature that speaks the password (determined by the caster at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm.  The caster decides at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.

Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts the caster (and only the caster) so long as he or she remains within 1 mile of the warded area.  The caster will hear a single mental “ping” sufficient to awaken the caster from normal sleep, but which does not otherwise disturb concentration.  A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.

Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 ft of the warded area can hear it clearly.  Interposing doors or walls may reduce the distance by 10 ft or 20 ft.  The sound lasts for 1 round.  Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing. 

Incorporeal creatures do not trigger the alarm.
