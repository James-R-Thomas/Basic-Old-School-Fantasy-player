## Analyze Magic                                            

Duration: special

Range:    5’

This spell permits the caster to discover information about a magic item or a permanently enchanted area.  For each turn spent studying the enchanted item or area, the caster may learn one feature of the enchantment.  Features include spell effects, bonuses, and command words or activating conditions. The GM will choose the order in which the features are revealed, but command words or activating conditions should be last.  Note that the number of charges remaining for a charged item is not revealed by this spell.

Each turn of study requires the caster to make a d20 roll, adding his or her Intelligence bonus and level. The total result must be 16 or higher to succeed; any failure ends the spell.  A natural 1 is always a failure.

The item or area to be studied must be within 5' of the caster for the full duration of scrutiny, and he or she must maintain moderate concentration.

Even with the best rolls, the caster can only learn about one feature per level of ability.  The caster does not initially know how many features an item has, but he or she knows when the last feature is discovered (if the caster makes it that far).

With respect to bonuses (for magic weapons, etc.) use the following table:

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Analyze Magic Bonus for Magic Items|   |   |   |   |   |
||Bonus|   |   |   |   |
|Description|+1|+2|+3|+4|+5|
|Weak|1-18|1|1|--||
|Moderate|19-20|2-19|2-7|1||
|Strong|--|20|8-19|2-19|1-2|
|Very Strong|--|--|20|20|3-20|

So, for a Sword +1, +3 vs. Dragons, if the caster makes his or her first roll (learning about the first feature, the base +1), the GM rolls 1d20 secretly. If the GM gets 1-18, he or she describes the basic enchantment as "weak;" if he gets 19 or 20, it's "moderate." If the second roll is made (for the +3 vs. Dragons), the GM rolls again, but this time the most likely result is "strong" (or more precisely, "strongly enchanted against Dragons"). The caster will know at this point (but not before) that there are no further features to discover.
