## Animate Natural Objects           

Duration: 1 round/level

Range: 100'+10'/level

This spell functions identically to the cleric spell animate objects, but it may only be cast on living trees, plants, or fungi, wooden objects, un-worked stone or earth, or naturally-occurring bodies of water or ice.  At the GM's option other natural phenomena such as non-magical fires or weather effects might also be subject to this spell.
