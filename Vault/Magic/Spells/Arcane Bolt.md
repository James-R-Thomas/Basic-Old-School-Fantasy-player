## Arcane Bolt                              

This is a bolt of raw magic. The Magic-User doesn't roll anything, but the target gets a save vs. magic to avoid all damage. The bolt has a range of 30 feet and does 1d4+ half caster level damage. Since it is pure magic, it will affect creatures which are only affected by magical weapons, but does not affect inanimate objects.
