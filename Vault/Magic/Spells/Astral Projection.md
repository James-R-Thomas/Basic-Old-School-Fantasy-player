## Astral Projection                                  

Duration: special

Range: self

This spell frees the caster’s spirit (or soul) from his or her body, allowing it to travel to another plane. The caster may bring along up to one other creature per two caster levels as long as all participants are linked in a circle when the spell is cast.

The participants’ spirits are immediately transported to the destination plane where they form a new body. This new body will appear to be exactly the same as their original body, but will be acclimated to survive on this new plane. They will also have clothing and equipment identical to they were wearing when the spell was cast, though only exceptional magic items will be duplicated; most magic items will be replaced with normal items. This spell leaves the participants’ original bodies in suspended animation.

This spell will last indefinitely. It will end when the caster chooses to end the spell or the caster's new body dies. In either case, all of the new bodies pop out of existence, and the participants’ spirits return to their original bodies. If a participant other than the caster wills it, or their new body dies, they return on their own, leaving the others behind. If the original body of anyone who is still under the effects of the spell is killed, the character is killed and their new body pops out of existence.

Unlike gate, the destination cannot be the same plane as the plane of origin. Also, astral projection cannot be cast while still in the new body. To go to a different plane, the caster must end the spell, bringing everyone back to their original bodies and cast a new spell from their original bodies.
