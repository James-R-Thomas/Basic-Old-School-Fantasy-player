[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Blacklight   

Duration: 1 turn per level

Range: 60’

Twisting the nature of light and darkness, this spell creates a 30’ diameter area of illumination which cannot be perceived outside of this area.

> Stealth: It is thus possible for those within the area of blacklight to see in utter darkness while not revealing their own presence.

> Area: The caster may cause the area of blacklight to manifest either in a designated area within range or about their own person. (In the latter case, the magical effect moves with the caster.)

> Magical darkness: The illumination created by blacklight does not penetrate magical darkness.
