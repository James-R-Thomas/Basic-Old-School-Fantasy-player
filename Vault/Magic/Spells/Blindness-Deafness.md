[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Blindness-Deafness   

Duration: Permanent

Range: 30’

A single creature is afflicted by a phantasm which nullifies either its visual or aural sensory input (as selected by the caster), rendering it blind or deaf.

> Saving throw: The target may save versus spells to avoid the phantasm.

> Removing: As the blindness or deafness caused by this spell is illusory, it cannot be removed by magic that cures disease. The affliction may be removed by spells that dispel magic or illusions.

> Cancelling: The caster may cancel the spell’s effect at will.
