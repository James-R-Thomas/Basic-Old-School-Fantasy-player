[[Cleric Spell List]]

## Censure    

Duration: instantaneous

Range: 30'

The cleric casting this spell utters a condemnation of the target's behavior or conduct; the spell then creates a point of divine energy, which the cleric directs at the target.  The cleric must roll to hit, and if he or she misses then the spell has no effect.  If the target is hit, then roll on the following table to determine the spell's effect on the target:

|1|Stunned for 1d4+1 rounds|
|2-3|Paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds|
|4-5|Move slowed by half for 1d4+1 rounds|
|6|Number of attacks reduced by half for 1d4+1 rounds|
