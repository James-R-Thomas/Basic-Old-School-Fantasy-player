[[Druid Spell List]]

## Changestaff    

Duration: 1 hour/level

Range: touch

This spell transforms a specially prepared staff into a treant-like creature. The creature looks and fights just like a treant, and will follow all directions given by the caster. The creature is not an actual treant, and so cannot talk to other treants or animate trees. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it disintegrates and the staff is destroyed. If the duration expires, or the caster ends the spell early, the creatures transforms back into the staff.

The staff used must be a specially prepared quarterstaff made from ask, oak, or yew. It must be finished using a special process requiring a full week. No adventuring can take place while preparing the staff.
