[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Chromatic Orb                    

Duration: Instant

Range: 60’

This spell conjures an orb of pure color that shoots towards a visible target within range.

> Color: The caster may conjure an orb of one of the colors listed in the table opposite, depending on their experience level and the gems available.

> Gemstone: The color orb is created by refracting and amplifying the pure hue and intrinsic properties of a gemstone, which must be in the caster’s possession. Casting chromatic orb does not cause the gemstone to be consumed.

> Value: The gem to be used must be of a certain minimum value (indicated in the table opposite).

> Hit: The orb hits unerringly, inflicting damage on the target and another effect that depends on its color.

#### Chromatic Orb Eﬀects

Light: If the target fails a saving throw versus spells, it is surrounded by light in a 15’ radius for 1d4 rounds. In low light conditions, attacks against the target gain a +2 bonus. Any attempts at stealth or surprise on the target’s part may be nullified.

Heat: If the target fails a saving throw versus spells, it suffers a –2 penalty to attacks, saves, and AC for 1d4 rounds. The heat of the ruby orb may also be used to melt up to a cubic yard of ice.

Fire: All flammable objects within 2’ of the target are set alight. If the target fails a saving throw versus spells, flammable objects (e.g. clothing, hair, etc.) on its person are also set alight. This inflicts 1d3 damage for 1d4 rounds, unless the target spends a round extinguishing the flames.

Blindness: The target is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it saves versus spells. A blind creature cannot attack.

Stench: A 5’ radius cloud of stinking vapors erupts at the target’s location. Creatures within the cloud (including the target) must save versus poison or be overcome with nausea—unable to act except to move at half movement rate. Once leaving the cloud, the nausea subsides after 1d4 rounds. The cloud disperses after 1 turn.

Magnetism: The electrical energy of the orb strongly magnetizes any metal objects on the target (e.g. armor, weapons) unless a saving throw versus spells is made. The magnetic charge lasts for 1d4 rounds and causes metal objects to stick together. A target wearing metal armor suffers a –2 penalty to AC and is unable to attack with metal weapons.

Paralysis: Unless a saving throw versus paralysis is made, the target is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.
