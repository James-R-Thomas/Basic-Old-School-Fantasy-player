## Clairaudience                                            

Duration: 12 turns

Range:    60’

This spell enables the caster to hear sounds in another area through the ears of a living creature in that area.  The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 60' away.  If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails.  No saving throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used.  The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed.  If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.
