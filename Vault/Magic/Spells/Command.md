[[Cleric Spell List]]

## Command          

Duration: 1 round

Range: 10'

The caster speaks a single-word command which will be obeyed by a single creature within the given range.  The command must be given in a language the recipient understands.  The recipient will do its best to obey, as long as the command is a clear, imperative verb.  "Suicide" isn't a verb.  "Die" would cause the recipient to fake death for the duration of the spell (believing it was dead).  Typical commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, fly, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, etc.

Undead are not affected. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 or more and creatures with 6 or more hit dice may save vs. Spells to resist.
