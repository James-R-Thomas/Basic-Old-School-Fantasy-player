## Control Undead                      

Duration: 6 rounds/level

Range: 60’

This spell allows for complete control of up to 3 HD/caster level of undead for a short period of time.  Verbal control is required, but they will understand regardless of the language used.  If communication is not possible, they will still not attack.  Intelligent undead creatures may save vs. Spells to resist and will remember if they are controlled.  Unintelligent undead do not get a saving throw and the control is permanent.  Any unintelligent undead controlled using this spell count against the caster’s total control limit.
