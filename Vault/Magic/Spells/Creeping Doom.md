## Creeping Doom        

Duration: 1 minute/level

Range: 300’+30’/level

This is a more powerful form of insect plague. It summons one swarm of centipedes per two caster levels, to a maximum of ten swarms at 20th level. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one continuous area). The caster may summon the centipede swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms may be directed to move after being summoned.

Centipede swarms act as insect swarms, but have 8 HD, do 2d6 points of damage, have a movement rate of 20 feet, and cannot fly.
