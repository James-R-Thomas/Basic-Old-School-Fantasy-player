## Delayed Blast Fireball                                  

Duration: special

Range: 100'+10'/level

This spell creates a small glowing bead at any location chosen by the caster, up to the listed range. This bead will explode in an improved form of fireball at a time chosen by the caster; when it explodes, it will do 1d6+1 points of damage per caster level to all within a spherical volume with a 20' radius, just as with the standard fireball spell.  The bead may explode immediately if the caster so desires, or may be delayed up to 10 rounds; the caster chooses the time when the spell is cast, and cannot subsequently be changed.

If a delay is chosen, the glowing bead lies at its destination until it detonates.  A creature can pick up and hurl the bead (with the same range as a dagger); if the bead is handled within 1 round of its scheduled detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates instantly, i.e. before it can be thrown.
