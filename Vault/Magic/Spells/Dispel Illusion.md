## Dispel Illusion       

Duration: Instant

Range: 10’ per level

Dispel illusion ends ongoing illusions or phantasms (i.e. those with a non-instantaneous duration) within a 20’ cube area.

> Spells cast by a non-illusionist: Are automatically dispelled.

> Spells cast by another illusionist: Have a chance of not being dispelled. If the level of the caster of the effect to be dispelled is higher than the level of the caster of dispel illusion, there is a 5% chance per level difference that the attempt to dispel will fail.

> Magic items: Are unaffected.
