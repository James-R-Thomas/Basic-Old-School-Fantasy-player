[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Dream Quest   

Duration: Permanent until fulfilled

Range: 60’

The caster commands a single subject to perform a specific quest or task, conveyed through a recurring dream.

> The dream: While the spell remains in effect, the subject experiences the recurring dream every time they sleep. In the recurring dream, the subject witnesses themselves completing the prescribed quest.

> Examples of quests: Rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific monster, bringing a magic item to the caster, or going on a journey to an oracle.

> Suicidal quests: The prescribed quest must not be obviously suicidal.

> Saving throw: The subject may save versus spells, with success indicating that the initial dream is experienced but the spell has no further effect.

> Refusal: The subject must undertake the quest or begin to fade from reality. Every day in which the subject does not pursue the quest, they lose 1 hit point. This damage cannot be fatal (e.g. if the subject has only 1 hit point, no further loss due to this spell will occur). However, accrued damage cannot be healed by any means except completing the quest.

> Completion: Once the task is completed, the spell ends. Any lost hit points are recovered.
