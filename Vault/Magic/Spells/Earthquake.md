## Earthquake            

Duration: 1 round

Range: 400’+40’/level

When cast, this spell causes a powerful, but localized, earthquake that is 10 feet in diameter per caster level. The shock of the quake will knock down creatures, topple plants, collapse structures, open cracks in the earth, and more. The effect lasts for one round, during which creatures in the affected area cannot move or act. The earthquake affects everything touching the ground in the affected area. The specific effect depends on the type of terrain where the spell is cast:

Cave, cavern, tunnel: Causes the roof to collapse causing 8d6 damage to everyone in the affected area (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble. Small rooms and tunnels become completely filled.

Cliff: Causes a landslide. Any creatures in the path take 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage), pinning all creatures beneath the rubble.

Open ground: All creatures in the area must save vs. Petrify or fall to the ground. Fissures open up and all creatures in the area have a 1 in 4 chance of falling in (save vs. Death Ray to avoid). After the end of the spell, the fissures close up, killing anything that fell in.

Structures: Any structures directly touching the affected ground take 100 points of damage, ignoring hardness. If this causes the structure to collapse, anyone trapped inside takes 8d6 damage (save vs. Petrify for half damage) and is pinned beneath the rubble.

River, lake, marsh: Fissures in the bottom drain the water away, resulting in a muddy quicksand-like surface to remain. All creatures in the affected area must save vs. Death Ray or be stuck. After the end of the spell, the surrounding water rushes back in, potentially drowning any creatures stuck in the mud.

Any creature pinned by rubble takes 1d6 points of non-lethal damage per minute until rescued or they fall unconscious. Once unconscious, they take 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute until they are rescued or die.
