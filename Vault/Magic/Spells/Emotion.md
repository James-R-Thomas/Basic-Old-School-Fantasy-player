[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Emotion  

Duration: Concentration

Range: 10’ per level

All creatures in a 40’ square area within range must save versus spells or be afflicted by an emotion of the caster’s choosing:

> Fear: Subjects are struck with terror and will flee from the caster at maximum speed. Affected creatures have a 60% chance of immediately dropping anything in their hands. The chance is decreased by 5% for each level or Hit Die above 1.

Fear counters ongoing rage effects.

> Hate: Subjects gain a +2 bonus to attacks, damage, saving throws, and morale. Hate counters ongoing hopelessness effects.

> Hopelessness: Subjects are utterly demoralized and will dejectedly follow enemies’ orders (e.g. to surrender or leave). In combat, there is a 1-in-4 chance of a subject doing nothing each round, and a 1-in-4 chance of them retreating.

Hopelessness counters ongoing hate effects.

> Rage: Subjects go berserk, gaining a

+1 bonus to hit and +3 to damage. Subjects fight without thought for their own lives and will not use shields. Subjects also gain 5 temporary hit points. These may take a subject above its normal maximum, but disappear when the spell ceases. Rage counters ongoing fear effects.

Concentration: Is required to maintain the projected emotion. If the caster moves or loses concentration, the spell ends.
