## Familiar                                                       

Duration: special

Range: touch

With this spell, the caster binds a single animal into his service as a familiar.  The creature must be present, and the caster must touch it to cast the spell.  Only normal (non-magical) creatures of 1-1 hit die or lower and having animal intelligence may be made into familiars.  Further, each spellcaster may have only one familiar at a time.  If a familiar dies, the caster will not be able to successfully cast this spell again for 2d6 months (the period to be rolled by the GM and not revealed to the player).  A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist, and if this roll succeeds, the animal chosen is not compatible with the caster and cannot become his or her familiar.

The familiar will behave as if permanently charmed by its master, and will perform any task assigned to it to the best of its ability.  The creature's morale is increased by 2 points (to a maximum of 11), and it receives improved intelligence equal to 3+1d4 points.  Familiars normally capable of speech (such as parrots) or sign language (such as monkeys) can even carry on conversations. Familiars also age at half the normal rate for their kind, so a cat familiar (for instance) might easily live forty years.

The familiar and its master are linked telepathically, allowing normal communication in both directions.  The caster can see through the eyes of the familiar with moderate concentration.  He or she can also sense the direction and approximate distance to the familiar (in general terms, such as "northeast more than a mile away" or "south more than a hundred miles and underground") by concentrating fully upon it for 1d6 rounds.

The connection between the master and familiar will extend any distance on the same plane, but if they are on different planes, the familiar saves vs. Spells once per week with success meaning it has been freed from the master. The freed familiar loses all benefits gained from this spell and becomes a normal animal.  The master is affected as if his familiar has died.  If the familiar was well treated by its former master it will be friendly toward him or her should they meet again, and the master may cast this spell (even if the normal time limit has not expired) to re-bind the animal as his or her familiar again.
