## Find the Path          

Duration: 1 turn/level

Range: touch

This spell grants the caster, or another subject the caster touches, the ability to find the best and shortest route to a destination selected by the caster.  The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster.  Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.

This spell works as well indoors or even underground as it does in the outdoors.  However, find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures.  It can only lead someone to a destination that is on the same plane of existence as the caster when cast; this can be very limiting if the caster (and subject if any) is in a closed or pocket universe of some kind.

The subject can sense the approximate direction of the destination, but also knows the best path to get there, sensing each turning and knowing which paths or corridors to follow when choices appear (but not sooner, unfortunately).  The spell even overcomes things such as secret doors, which the subject will sense and know how to open, and grants the knowledge of passwords or codes at the correct moments.

Note that the spell will always choose the best path.  For example, if the shortest way requires the use of a key which the subject does not have, the spell will choose a different, probably longer way if possible.  If this is not possible, the subject will be led to the locked door and will understand that they must find a way to pass through on their own.

The spell ends when the subject arrives at the destination or when the duration expires, whichever comes first.  If the duration expires before arrival, the subject may still remember the approximate direction to the destination but will no longer know the way.
