## Fire Storm                                  

Duration: instantaneous

Range: 100’+10’/level

 This spell causes an area 20’x10’x10’ per caster level to be filled with holy fire. The caster can determine the shape of the area, but the entire area must be contiguous. Any creature in the designated area takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any immunity or resistance to fire. Any creature that dies from the damage (or was already dead when the fire storm is cast) is completely consumed by the fire. The fire only harms creatures and does not affect the surrounding environment.
