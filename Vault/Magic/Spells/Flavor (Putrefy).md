## Flavor                              

This cantrip may either make one dish taste any way the caster wants it to (which is an illusion), or add salt, spice, sweetener, or another flavoring agent (which is real). Reversed, it becomes putrefy, which makes the food or drink either go bad (which is real) or taste as if it had been prepared wrongly (which is an illusion).
