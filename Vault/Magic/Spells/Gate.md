## Gate                                                

Duration: special

Range: 120’

This spell creates an inter-dimensional connection between the caster’s location and another plane. This allows for travel between the two locations in either direction. The gate stays open as long as the caster concentrates on it, up to 1 round/caster level plus one additional round.

The gate appears as a flat circle with a diameter of 5 to 20 feet (caster's choice). It can be situated at any angle, but will usually be vertical. The back (the side facing away from the caster) is filled with an insubstantial opaque haze and passing through does nothing. The front shows where the gate is connected. This is full opening between locations with complete visibility (subject to the conditions on the other side; from a place in the air to a place in the water will get expected results) and accessibility. The gate is full two-way, and anyone on either side can pass back and forth either way, including going one way and back the other as long as the gate stays open. Any number of people or things can use the gate, subject to the spell's duration and normal physical constraints. When the spell expires (or if the caster ends or loses concentration) it goes away, but can always be recreated by casting the spell again.

Note that the spell will allow both sides to be on the same plane if so desired, and that means it can also work as a very powerful alternative to teleportation.

As long as the destination is known and exists as known, the gate will open where desired. If not, the gate will open in a random location on the plane (i.e. wherever the GM wants it to). Some extraordinary creatures, at the GM’s discretion, are powerful enough to detect that a gate is about to open and prevent it from opening, thereby immediately canceling the spell.
