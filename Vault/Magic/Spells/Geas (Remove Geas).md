## Geas       

Duration: Permanent / Instant (remove Demand)

Range: 30’

The caster commands a subject to perform or avoid performing a specific action.

> Examples: Bringing a specific item to the caster, eating or drinking without restraint, keeping a certain fact secret.

> Impossible or deadly tasks: The prescribed Demand must not be impossible or directly deadly—if such a Demand is cast, it affects the caster, instead.

> Saving throw: The subject may save versus spells, to avoid coming under the spell’s effect.

> If the save fails: The subject must follow the stipulated course of action or suffer gradually increasing (and eventually fatal) penalties determined by the referee (e.g. penalties to attack, ability score reductions, inability to memorize spells, physical torment and feebleness, etc.).

#### Reversed: Remove Geas

Can dispel an active Demand spell and any incurred penalties. If the caster of the Demand to be nullified is higher level than the character casting remove Demand, there is a chance of the spell having no effect. The probability of spell failure is 5% per level the caster is below the caster of Demand.
