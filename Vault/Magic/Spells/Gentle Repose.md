[[Cleric Spell List]]

## Gentle Repose    

Duration: 1 day/level

Range: touch

This spell preserves the remains of a dead creature (including a zombie, if so desired). This prevents any decay of the remains for the duration of the spell. This extends the time limit imposed by raise dead, allowing for a longer time to cast the spells.
