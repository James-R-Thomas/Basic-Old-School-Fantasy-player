The caster is wrapped in an illusion, taking on the outward appearance of another humanoid. Two variants are possible, chosen as the spell is cast:

Imagined form: The caster takes on a form which they imagine.

Duplicate individual: The caster copies the form of a living individual whom they touch. An attack roll is required if the target is unwilling.

Stipulations: The following apply:

> Height: The illusionary form may be at most 1’ taller or shorter than the caster’s normal form.

> Weight: Apparent weight may be altered in any way.

> Gear: Clothing or items may be altered in any way.

> Observers: If the spell is used to copy another’s appearance, those familiar with the copied individual may save versus spells to detect the ruse.
