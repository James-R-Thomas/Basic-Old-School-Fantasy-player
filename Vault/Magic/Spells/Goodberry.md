## Goodberry    

Duration: 1 day/level

Range: touch

This spell, when cast on a bush or tree, causes it to sprout a handful of berries, 2d4 of which are magical. The caster (and any Druid of 3rd level or greater) can immediately recognize which are magical. Eating a magical berry provides the equivalent of a full meal to a human (or similar creature) and heals 1 point of damage. No one can heal more than 8 points of damage using these berries in a single day.
