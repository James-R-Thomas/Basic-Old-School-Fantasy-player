## Greater Teleport                       

Duration:  instantaneous

Range: self

This spell functions in a similar fashion to the normal teleport spell, except there no chance of arriving off target.  In addition, the caster need not have seen the destination, if he or she has at least a reliable description of it.  If the caster attempts to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), he or she disappears and then reappears in the original location.  This spell cannot transport the caster to another plane of existence.
