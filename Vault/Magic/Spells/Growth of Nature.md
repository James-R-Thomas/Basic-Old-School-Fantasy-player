## Growth of Nature        

Duration: 12 turns (animals) or permanent (plants)

Range: 120’

This spell has two uses:

Animal growth: Doubling the size of a normal, non-magical animal.

Plant growth: Causing vigorous growth of normal vegetation.

##### When used to affect an animal:

> Strength: The animal’s strength is doubled, along with the damage inflicted by its attacks and the amount of weight it can carry.

> Restrictions: This spell may be used on giant versions of normal animals, but intelligent animals and fantastic monsters are unaffected.

##### When used to affect plants:

> Area: Plants in an area within range of up to 3,000 square feet are affected. The area is selected by the caster (e.g. 150’ × 20’, 100’ × 30’, etc.).

> Passage: Plants in the affected area become thick and overgrown, entwining to form a thorny jungle that only very large creatures can force their way through.
