## Heal                                               

Duration: permanent

Range: touch

This spell enables the caster to almost totally cure wounds, diseases, and other afflictions of a single living creature.  With a touch the caster cures blindness, deafness, confusion, disease, feeblemind, choking, nausea, and poison.  All but 1d4 hit points are restored to the subject, if it has any injuries.  Ability points losses are fully restored, if and only if those losses would be recoverable without this spell; permanent losses to ability scores are not recovered.  Energy drain is also not affected by this spell.

### Reversed: Harm

Injures the creature touched so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points.  The caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted.  Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, they will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which harm may kill a creature).

Heal and harm normally only affect living creatures.  If applied to an undead creature, the effects are reversed such that heal becomes harm and vice versa.
