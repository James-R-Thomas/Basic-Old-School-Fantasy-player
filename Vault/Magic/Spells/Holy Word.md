[[Cleric Spell List]]

## Holy Word                                     

Duration: instantaneous

Range: 30' radius

This spell represents the single most powerful word of any cleric's purest faith.  When uttered, the cleric pulses with a blinding radiance and all enemies of the cleric within a 30' radius that can hear him suffer 1d6 points of damage per level of the cleric.  Because of the searing light emanating from him, each enemy within range that can see the cleric must make a save vs. Spells or be blinded.  Creatures struck dead by this spell burst into fierce flames and burn down to a fine ash within a single round.
