[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Hypnotism                                           

Duration: 1 round +1 per level

Range: 30’

The caster’s gestures and droning syllables open the minds of one or more subjects within range to a hypnotic suggestion that is uttered as part of the spell casting.

> Number of targets: Up to 1d6 creatures are affected. The number of creatures affected is determined after the suggestion is made.

> Wording: The suggestion must take the form of a short phrase (at most one or two sentences) suggesting a course of action to the subjects.

> Comprehension: A language that is understood by the subjects must be used.

> Harmful suggestions: A suggested course of action that is obviously harmful to a subject causes the spell to automatically fail for that subject.

> Saving throw: Each subject may save versus spells to resist the hypnotic suggestion. If the save fails, the subject will follow the caster’s suggestion for up to the duration of the spell.

> Reasonable suggestions: A suggestion that is worded in such a way to make it sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penalty to the saving throw.

**Restrictions:** Undead are not affected by hypnotism.
