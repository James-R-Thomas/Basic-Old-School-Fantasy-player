[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Illusion                       

Duration: 1 round per level

Range: 240’

An illusion of the caster’s choosing— including sounds, smells, and thermal elements—manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types of illusions may be created:

An illusionary monster: That can be directed to attack. The monster has AC 5 [14]. If it is hit in combat, the attacker may save versus spells. If the save succeeds, the attacker realizes the illusory nature of the monster and can no longer be harmed by it.

An illusionary attack: For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets who save versus spells are unaffected.

A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new.

The following stipulations apply:

> Responsiveness: The illusion behaves and responds as decided by the caster when the spell is cast. No concentration is required to maintain the illusion.

> Illusionary monsters or attacks: May appear to be harmful but never inflict real damage. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralyzed, and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.

> Illusions from imagination: If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.
