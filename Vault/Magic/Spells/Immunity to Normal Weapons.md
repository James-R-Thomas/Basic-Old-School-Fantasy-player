## Immunity to Normal Weapons

Duration: 5 rounds+1/level

Range:    touch

This spell temporarily makes the target immune to non-magical weapons. Anyone affected by this spell is treated as an enchanted creature for the purpose of magic which specifically affects them (for instance, a sword +1, +3 vs. enchanted creatures applies its special bonus to a creature protected by this magic).
