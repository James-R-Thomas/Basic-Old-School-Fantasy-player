## Longevity                                        

Duration: permanent

Range: self

This spell will halt the aging process in the caster for 1d4+1 years.  During this period, the caster's physical appearance and general health remain as they were at the time of the casting, as if he or she has not aged a day.  Aging attacks, such as those from a ghost, subtract from the Longevity years first before actually aging the victim. Because of the tremendous magical strain of this spell on the body and soul, a caster can only benefit from it once every 5 years.  Casting this spell requires a bloodstone gem of at least 2,000 gp in value, which is consumed in the casting.
