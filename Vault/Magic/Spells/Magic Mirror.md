## Magic Mirror        

Duration: 1 round/level 

Range: 10’

Turns a reflective surface within range into a magic mirror through which the caster can view other creatures.  The caster must know and name the creature.  The caster and any other creatures viewing the mirror will be able to see the images, but only the caster will hear sound from the viewing.  Detection and vision spells can be cast into it with a 3% chance per caster level of success.  If successful, this allows the caster to cast detect magic, see invisible, etc. through the mirror.
