[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Major Creation   

Duration: 12 or 6 turns per level

Range: Touch

Over the course of a turn, the caster weaves a semi-real but tangible object from a tiny piece of constituent matter. For example, a sword could be formed from a splinter of steel.

> Non-living: Only objects of non-living vegetable or mineral matter may be created (e.g. fabric, rope, wood, metal, stone, etc.).

> Size: The object may be no larger than one cubic foot per level of the caster.

> Food: While it is possible to create food, its semi-real nature means that it provides no nourishment.

> Duration: If objects of vegetable matter are created, the duration is 12 turns per level, otherwise it is 6 turns per level.

> When the duration ends: The conjured item disappears. The piece of matter from which it was woven remains.
