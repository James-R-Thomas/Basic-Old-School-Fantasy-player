[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Mass Suggestion                                              

Duration: 4 turns +4 per level

Range: 90’

The caster utters a suggestion to influence the behavior of selected subjects within range.

> Number of subjects: Up to one subject per level of the caster may be targeted.

> Wording: The suggestion must take the form of a short phrase (at most one or two sentences) suggesting a course of action to the subjects.

> Comprehension: A language that is understood by the subjects must be used.

> Harmful suggestions: Suggestions that are obviously harmful to a subject cause the spell to automatically fail for that subject.

> Saving throw: A save versus spells is allowed to resist the suggestion. If the save fails, the subject will follow the

caster’s suggestion for up to the duration of the spell.

> Reasonable suggestions: A suggestion that is worded in such a way to make it sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penalty to the saving throw.

Restrictions: Undead are unaffected.
