[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Minor Creation      

Duration: 6 turns per level

Range: Touch

Over the course of one turn, the caster weaves a semi-real but tangible object from a tiny piece of constituent matter. For example, a semi-real rope could be formed from a strand of hemp fiber.

> Non-living: Only objects of non-living vegetable matter may be created (e.g. fabric, rope, wood, etc.).

> Size: The object may be no larger than one cubic foot per level of the caster.

> Food: While it is possible to create food, its semi-real nature means that it provides no nourishment.

> When the duration ends: The conjured item disappears. The piece of matter from which it was woven remains.
