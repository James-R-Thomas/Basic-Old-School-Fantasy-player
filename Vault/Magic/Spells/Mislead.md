[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Mislead                                    

Duration: 1 round per level

Range: The caster

This spell causes an illusory double of the caster to appear while the real caster is rendered invisible.

> Appearance: The illusion of the double includes visual, sonic, olfactory, and tactile elements. It is an entirely convincing double of the caster.

> Action: The double may act completely independently, including moving, speaking, attacking, and casting spells (that the caster has memorized).

> Combat: The double has the same combat capabilities as the caster and has a separate pool of hit points, equal to those of the caster when the spell is cast.

The caster is rendered invisible as follows:

> Attacking: The caster may attack while invisible.

> Being attacked: Opponents who are aware of the caster’s presence (but who cannot see invisible) may detect a faint shimmering, allowing them to locate the caster. The caster gains a +4 bonus to AC and saving throws against such attacks.

> Equipment: Any gear the caster is carrying is also rendered invisible (this includes clothing and armor). Items dropped or put down become visible.

> Light sources: If a light source is made invisible (as part of the caster’s gear), the light it casts is unaffected.
