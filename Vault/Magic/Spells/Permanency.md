## Permanency           

Duration: permanent

Range: 10’

This spell is used to make another spell of 6th or lower level permanent.  Only arcane magic can be affected: Clerical, Druidic, and other spells of divine nature can not be made permanent.  No spell with a permanent or instantaneous duration can be made permanent.

A permanency spell lasts until dispelled.  When it is dispelled, the other spell effect vanishes immediately.  Casting a permanency spell causes the loss of 1 point of Constitution. Lost Constitution is recovered using the Constitution Point Losses rules from the Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rule Book.

No more than two spells can be made permanent on a single person, item or place.  If a third permanency spell is cast it automatically fails, and there is a 50% that each of the two other permanency spells fails too.

A permanency spell is not necessary to make any magical item; using permanency to bind a spell to an object, person, or place is not the same as crafting a magic item.

Spells that are commonly made permanent on a creature: detect magic, protection from evil, read languages, read magic, tongues, detect invisible, and fly.

Spells commonly made permanent on items or locations include: alarm, animate objects, confusion, dancing lights, guards and wards, invisibility, phantasmal force, private sanctum, magic mouth, symbol, wall of fire, and web.
