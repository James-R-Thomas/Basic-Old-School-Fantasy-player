## Phase Door                                

Duration: 1 usage / 2 levels

Range: touch

This spell creates a magical passage through a wall, the floor, the ceiling, or even through a section of ground. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except the caster, who is the only one that can use the passage. The passage is 10 feet deep plus another 5 feet for every three caster levels. The caster disappears when entering the phase door and appears when he or she exits. If desired, the caster can take one other creature through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor it is possible to see through it without using it.

A phase door is subject to dispel magic, but only from someone who is of higher level than the caster. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he or she is harmlessly ejected (determine randomly in which direction).

It is possible to allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting a triggering condition for the door. This condition can be as simple or elaborate as desired. It can be based on a creature’s name or identity, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.
