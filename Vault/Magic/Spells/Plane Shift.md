[[Cleric Spell List]]

## Plane Shift  

Duration: instantaneous 

Range: touch

When cast, the caster or the creature touched is sent to another plane or dimension. If multiple creatures link hands in a circle, up to eight may plane shift. All participants must be willing. If any intended participant is unwilling, the spell fails with no effect. Plane shift is highly inaccurate and while the desired plane or dimension will always be reached, arrival will be 1-100 (d100) miles from the intended destination.
