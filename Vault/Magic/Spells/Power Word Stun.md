## Power Word Stun                         

Duration: variable

Range: 120’

The caster utters a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of his or her choice to become stunned, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The duration of the spell depends on the target’s current hit point total. Any creature that currently has 71 or more hit points is unaffected by power word stun. If the target has between 36 and 70 hit points, the duration is 1d6 rounds. If the target has 35 hit points or less, the duration is 2d6 turns.
