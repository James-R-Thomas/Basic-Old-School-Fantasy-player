## Prismatic Spray                                  

Duration: instantaneous

Range: 60’

This spell causes seven beams of brilliant, intertwined beams of colored light to shoot from the caster’s hands covering a cone shaped area. All creatures in the area of effect will be struck by one or two beams. (A given beam may strike more than one creature or potentially no creatures.) A saving throw vs. Spells will negate the effect of a beam for the struck creature. (A creature struck by two beams must make two saving throws.) Any creatures in the affected area that are 8 HD or less are blinded for 2d4 rounds with no saving throw.

The following table shows the effects of each colored beam. The comment in parentheses indicates the saving throw to use for either half damage or to negate.
