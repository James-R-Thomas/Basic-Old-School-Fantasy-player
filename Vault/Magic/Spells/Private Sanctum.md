[[Magic-User Spell List]]

## Private Sanctum                              

Duration: 24 hours

Range: 30’

This spell creates a field impenetrable to most kinds of scrutiny.  Those looking into the area from outside see only a dark, foggy mass.  Darkvision cannot penetrate it.  Eavesdroppers do not perceive any sound, no matter how loud, emanating from the area.  Those inside the affected area can see and hear outside the affected area normally.  Anyone inside the affected area are immune to ESP spells.

Divination spells: like magic mirror, clairvoyance, and clairaudience cannot perceive anything within the area.

No speech is possible: between those inside and those outside the sanctum.  The spell does not prevent other means of communication, such as telepathic communication, or such as that between a Magic-User and a familiar.

Private sanctum does not stop creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.
