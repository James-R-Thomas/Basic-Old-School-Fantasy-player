## Protection from Plants and Animals

Duration: 1 turn per level

Range: The caster

An invisible barrier is conjured around the caster’s person, preventing contact by either plants or animals.

> Plants or animals: When this spell is cast, the caster must choose whether the barrier is effective against plants (including plant-like monsters) or animals (normal and giant-sized but excluding fantastic creatures or those of greater than animal intelligence).

> Range: The magical barrier extends merely an inch from the caster’s body.

> Life-forms of the selected type: Cannot touch or physically attack the caster.

> Caster’s attacks: The caster cannot touch or attack affected life-forms except by using spells.

> A barrier of protection from plants: May be used to clear a path through dense undergrowth. The path may then be used by others.
