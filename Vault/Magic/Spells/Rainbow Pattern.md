[[Illusionist Spell List]]

## Rainbow Pattern   

Duration: Concentration

Range: 30’ square around the caster

A band of twisting, interweaving, rainbow colors fills the air in a 30’ × 30’ area centered on the caster.

> Creatures that see the pattern: Must save versus spells or become hypnotized as long as they are able to watch the pattern.

> Number of creatures affected: A total of up to 24 Hit Dice of creatures may be hypnotized.

> Hypnotized creatures: Simply stand still, gazing at the pattern of colors.

> If a hypnotized creature is harmed: The pattern ceases to enthrall it and it may act next round.

Maintaining the pattern: The pattern can be maintained and directed as follows:

> Concentration: The caster can maintain the pattern indefinitely, as long as they concentrate on the spell and remain stationary.

> Releasing: The caster may optionally end concentration and direct the pattern to drift away in a specified direction. The pattern drifts at a rate of 30’ per round and fades after 1d4 rounds. Hypnotized creatures will do their best to follow the pattern, but if they are led into a dangerous area, another saving throw versus spells is allowed to snap out of the trance.
