## Regenerate   

Duration: permanent

Range: touch

This is the most powerful of healing spells, able to cause lost or destroyed body parts, even internal organs, of a living creature to grow back and heal.  Severed body parts can be put back in place and will reattach fully in a round (or one round per body part if multiple parts are to be reattached), but re-growing any number of lost body parts requires a full turn.  In addition, the spell heals 3d8 points of damage just as if it were a normal cure wounds spell.
