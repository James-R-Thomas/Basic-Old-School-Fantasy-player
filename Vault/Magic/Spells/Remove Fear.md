## Remove Fear*                

Range: Touch (120')

Duration: 2 turns

This spell will calm the creature touched.  If the target creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.

The reverse of this spell, Cause Fear, causes one target creature within 120' to become frightened; if the target fails to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns.  Creatures with 6 or more hit dice are immune to this effect.
