## Restoration                                          

Duration: permanent

Range: touch

Each casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature who has suffered energy drain.  At 16th level, two negative levels may be removed.  See the rules for Energy Drain (in the Encounter section on page 58) for more details.

Alternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score points.  If applied to a character who has temporarily lost ability points, it will restore up to 2d4 lost points to any one drained ability immediately.  If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability points, 1 point can be restored.

This spell cannot restore any levels lost permanently, such as those lost due to death as described for the spells raise dead and reincarnate.
