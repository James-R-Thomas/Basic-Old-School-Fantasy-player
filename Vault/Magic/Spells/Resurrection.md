## Resurrection                                     

Duration: instantaneous

Range: touch

This spell restores life to a deceased creature. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than ten years per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.

This spell operates similarly to raise dead, but is more powerful. The full body is not required; only a small portion is required, but that portion must have been part of the subject’s body at the time of death. (The dust left from a disintegrate spell counts as the required small portion.) A whole new body is created, so it will be at the peak of health, with full hit points, and all spells prepared at the time of death.

This is still an ordeal, however. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is resurrected, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.

A creature which has become undead can be resurrected as long as the undead creature has been destroyed. Constructs and elementals cannot be resurrected.

The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.
