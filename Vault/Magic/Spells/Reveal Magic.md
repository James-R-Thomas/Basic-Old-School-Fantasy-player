## Reveal Magic                                     

Duration: 1 minute

Range: 5’

This spell reveals all spell and magical properties of an object, creature, or permanently enchanted area examined with this spell. The caster must examine the object, creature, or location for an entire minute. In the case of a magic item, the caster will learn all of its functions, how to activate it (if required), and any charges left (if it has charges). If it is an object or creature with spells cast on it, or an enchanted area, the caster will learn what spells, their effects, and the caster level of those spells.

Any object or magic item that is held by someone who does not want the object or magic item examine may negate the spell with a successful saving throw vs. Spells. Likewise a creature that does not want to be examined may also negate the spell with a successful saving throw vs. Spells.
