## Ring of Lesser Healing    

Duration: instantaneous

Range: 15 ft. radius

This spell allows the caster to create an effect equivalent to the spell cure light wounds affecting multiple creatures within a 15' radius.  This spell thus cures 1d6+1 points of damage for the caster plus one living creature per 3 caster levels.  If more creatures are within the area of effect than the caster may heal, then the caster must choose which creatures receive the healing.  Undead affected by this spell suffer damage rather than receiving healing; such a monster is allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist this damage fully.
