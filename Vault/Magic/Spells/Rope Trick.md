## Rope Trick      

Duration: 2 turns per level

Range: Touch

A rope is enchanted to rise up into the air, enabling the caster and others to climb it and disappear into an imaginary space.

> The rope: Rises up to its full length (or at most 30’) and hangs stiffly in the air, magically tethered at the upper end.

> Climbing the rope: The rope may be climbed normally.

> Imaginary space: Human-sized (or smaller) creatures that climb to the top of the rope disappear into the imaginary space beyond.

> Capacity: The imaginary space can hold up to six individuals.

> Hidden: Creatures inside the imaginary space cannot be perceived or affected in any way by those on the outside, in real space.

> Pulling up the rope: The rope may be pulled up into the imaginary space, also disappearing.

When the spell’s duration ends: The rope falls slack, the imaginary space disappears, and anyone inside the imaginary space reappears in mid air.
