Duration: 2 rounds + 1/level

Range: self

This spell causes opponents to ignore the caster.  Any opponent who might otherwise wish to attack or harm the caster must make a successful saving throw vs. Spells in order to do so; if this save fails, that opponent will behave as if the caster is not important and move on to whatever activity it would normally do if he or she were not present.  This spell does not prevent area effect attacks (fireball, ice storm, etc.) from harming the caster.  While under protection from the spell, the caster is unable to perform any offensive acts, but may take any other action desired.
