## Scintillating Pattern             

Duration: special

Range: 60’

This spell is similar to color cloud. It causes an area of vivid, twisting, discordant colors, causing creatures in the area of effect to become blinded or possibly unconscious.  The area covers 20 feet on each side. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its hit dice:

6 HD or less: The creature is unconscious for 2d4 rounds, then blinded for 1d4 rounds, then confused for 1d4 rounds.

7 to 9 HD: The creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds, then confused for 1d4 rounds.

10 or more HD: The creature is blinded for 1 round and confused for 1 round.

Confused creatures act as if under the effects of the confusion spell.

All creatures having more levels or hit dice than the spell caster are entitled to a save vs. Spells to negate the effect. Sightless creatures are not affected by scintillating pattern.
