Duration: 24 hours

Range: touch

This spell combines elements of several other illusion spells to protect against both divination and direct observation. The caster dictates what the illusion is and what will and will not be seen by any observers. The illusion is described in general terms and once set cannot be changed. The illusion is not static and the general terms must describe how the illusion changes over time. The area covered is a 30’ cube per caster level.

Any divination attempts of the area will see the illusion described. There is no save throw to prevent this.

Any direct observation can allow for a saving throw vs. Spells to disbelieve. Entering the area does not cancel the illusion, or even allow a save, as long as the observer does not run into anything that is incongruous and hidden creatures stay out of the observer’s way.
