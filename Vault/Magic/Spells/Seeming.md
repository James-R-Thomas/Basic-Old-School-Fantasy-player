## Seeming   

Duration: 12 hours

Range: 10’

This spell alters the outward appearance of one or more persons to that of another type of humanoid.

> Number of subjects: Up to one subject per two levels of the caster may be affected.

> The illusionary appearance: All subjects take on the appearance of the same type of creature (e.g. human, elf, goblin, etc.), but each remains a recognizable individual—they do not look like clones.

> Size and weight: The illusionary appearance may be at most 1’ taller or shorter than the subject. Apparent weight may be altered in any way.

> Clothing or equipment: May be altered in any way.

> Cloning: The spell cannot be used to precisely copy another’s appearance.

> Saving throw: Unwilling subjects may save versus spells to avoid being affected.
