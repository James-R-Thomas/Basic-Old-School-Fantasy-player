## Shadowcast  

Duration: Up to 6 turns +1 per level

Range: 30’

The shadows cast by the light of a candle are enchanted, causing them to re-enact events which previously occurred in the area where the spell is cast.

> Candle: The caster must light a candle and place it in the center of the area to be affected, which must otherwise be

in darkness. The candle burns down completely over the spell’s duration.

> Time span: The caster may choose to look back into the past up to six turns plus one turn per level.

> Shadow play: Once the starting point for the shadow re-enactment has been selected, the spell lasts for that amount of time, producing a shadowy replay of the past up to the moment the spell was cast.

> Silhouettes: Only silhouettes of past events in the area are produced; any sound or speech which occurred is not replicated.

Enhancement: The power of the illusion may be enhanced by using a specially manufactured candle:

> Special candle: The candle must be formed from the earwax of a giant monster (which must be obtained by adventuring) and be inlaid with fine runes in gold leaf (at a cost of 200gp).

> Sound: If such a candle is used, the shadow play is also accompanied by sound, faintly reproduced in the sputtering of the candle’s flame.
