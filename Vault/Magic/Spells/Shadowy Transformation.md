## Shadowy Transformation  

Duration: 1d4 rounds +1 per level

Range: The caster or a creature or object touched

An object or creature touched becomes shadowy and semi-ethereal.

If an object is touched:

> Insubstantial: The object becomes utterly insubstantial. It cannot be touched and provides no physical resistance. For example, a door transformed by this spell could be freely passed through.

> Size: The object may be no larger than one cubic foot per level of the caster.

> Magical objects: Magic items and objects created by spells (e.g. a wall of stone) cannot be targeted.

If a creature is touched:

> Insubstantial: The subject and everything it carries becomes insubstantial.

> Movement: The subject is able to pass through small holes and cracks.

> Invulnerability: Only ethereal creatures or magic may harm the subject.

> Pass undead: Undead will ignore the subject, believing them to be a phantom of some kind. Undead of 10 or more HD may save versus spells (at a –4 penalty) to notice the illusion.

> Saving throw: An unwilling subject may save versus spells to avoid the transformation.
