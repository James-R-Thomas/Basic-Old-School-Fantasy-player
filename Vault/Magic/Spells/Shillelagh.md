Druid 1      Duration: 1 minute/level

Range: touch

This turns any club or staff wielded by the caster into a magical weapon with a +1 bonus to hit and to damage. The club or staff also does 1d8 points of damage instead of its normal damage. This spell only affects a weapon held by the caster. If the caster releases the weapon, the benefits no longer apply, but, if the caster retrieves the weapon prior to the end of the spell, the benefits result until the spell ends.
