Slow Poison Range: Touch

Druid 2 Duration: 1 hour/level

The creature touched by the caster becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell’s duration does not affect the subject until the spell’s duration has expired. Slow poison does not cure any damage that poison may have already done, with exception of the following circumstances.

If cast on a character who received lethal damage from poison the previous round, the spell will remove that round's poison damage only, and delay it for the duration of the spell. Prior poison damage will remain unaffected, but, as noted above, no further damage is accrued until the spell lapses, and will never accrue if the poison is neutralized while this spell is in effect. This will give the poisoned victim an opportunity to seek a cure to neutralize the poison before it is fatal.
