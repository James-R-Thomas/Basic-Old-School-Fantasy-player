## Spectral Force   

Duration: Concentration

Range: 240’

An illusion of the caster’s choosing— including sounds, smells, and thermal elements—manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types of illusions may be created:

An illusionary monster: That can be directed to attack. The monster has AC 5 [14] and vanishes if hit in combat.

An illusionary attack: For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets who save versus spells are unaffected.

A scene: Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.

Stipulations: The following apply:

> Concentration: Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves at faster than half speed or loses concentration, the spell ends.

> Persistence: Even when the caster stops concentrating on the spell, the illusion persists for three further rounds.

> Illusionary monsters or attacks: May appear to be harmful but never inflict real damage. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralyzed, and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.

> Illusions from imagination: If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.
