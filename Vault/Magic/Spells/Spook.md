## Spook          

Duration: Until broken (see below)

Range: 10’

The caster gestures threateningly at an intelligent target within range.

> Saving throw: The target may save versus spells to avoid coming under the spell’s effect.

> An afflicted target: Perceives the caster as a monster from its worst nightmares and will flee from the caster at maximum speed.

> Breaking the spell: The target may make a new save versus spells each round with success indicating that the spell is broken. Until the spell is broken, the target believes it is being pursued by the imagined horror.
