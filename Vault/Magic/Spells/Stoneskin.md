## Stoneskin 

Duration:   1 turn/level

Range:       touch

Protects the caster. The caster's skin becomes hard and stone-like, protecting the caster by absorbing the first 10 points of damage from all attacks. (This operates like hardness.) Once the spell has absorbed 10 points of damage per caster level, the spell is discharged.
