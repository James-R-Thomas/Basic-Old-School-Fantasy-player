## Suggestion      

Duration: 4 turns +4 per level

Range: 30’

The caster utters a suggestion to influence the behavior of a selected subject.

> Wording: The suggestion must take the form of a short phrase (at most one or two sentences) suggesting a course of action to the subject.

> Comprehension: A language that is understood by the subject must be used.

> Harmful suggestions: Suggestions that are obviously harmful to the subject cause the spell to automatically fail.

##### > Saving throw: A save versus spells

is allowed to resist the suggestion. If the save fails, the subject will follow the caster’s suggestion for up to the duration.

> Reasonable suggestions: A suggestion that is worded in such a way to make it sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penalty to the saving throw.

Restrictions: Undead are unaffected.
