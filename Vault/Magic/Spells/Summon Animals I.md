## Summon Animals  

Duration: 3 turns

Range: 360’

Normal animals within range are summoned to the caster’s aid. The creatures that respond to the summons are determined as follows:

> Restrictions: Insects, arachnids, and other “bugs” are not summoned. Magical creatures and those of greater than animal intelligence are not summoned.

> Targeted summons: The caster may choose to limit the summons to creatures of specific species, or to specific, known individuals.

> Number of animals: A number of animals of total Hit Dice equal to the caster’s level will respond to the summons.

> Small animals: Normal, small animals (e.g. mice, sparrows, squirrels, etc.) are treated as one tenth of a HD, for this purpose.

Summoned creatures: Behave as follows:

> Arrival: They will come to the caster’s location as fast as they can.

> Comprehension: They understand the caster’s words while the spell lasts.

> Aid: They will aid the caster in whatever way they can.

> If the caster is being attacked: The summoned animals will attack the enemy, only fleeing if they fail a morale check.

> If the caster is not being attacked: Summoned animals will usually flee if harmed.

> Once an animal flees: The spell is broken for that animal.
