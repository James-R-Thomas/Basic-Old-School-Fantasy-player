## Summon Vermin                 

This cantrip summons one small, totally ordinary insect (such as a beetle, fly, or spider), a small rodent (such as a field mouse), or a cloud of gnats into a certain area. If targeted intelligently, the spell may be able to disrupt spellcasting, but will never deal any actual damage (including poison) to the target. 

### Reversed: Exterminate 

May kill any one creature of similar size as the ones described in the spell.
