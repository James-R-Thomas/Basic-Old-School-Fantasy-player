## Sword                                                

Duration: 1 round/level

Range: 30’

This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force.  The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as the caster desires, beginning in the round that the spell is cast.  The sword attacks its designated target once each round on the caster's normal initiative turn.  The sword attacks as a fighter of the same level as the caster, and the attack roll is modified by the caster's Intelligence bonus.  The sword inflicts 3d4 points of damage on a successful hit, and can hit even creatures immune to non-magical weapons.  On a natural roll of 19 or 20, it will automatically hit its target, no matter its armor class.  The sword can only be destroyed by a successful application of dispel magic
