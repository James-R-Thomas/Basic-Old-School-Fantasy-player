## Through the Looking Glass                         

Duration: 1 round per level

Range: 10’

A finely wrought, full-length, silver mirror is enchanted to act as a scrying device, allowing the caster to view any place or object that is brought to mind:

> The clarity of the vision: Depends on the scryer’s familiarity with the subject.

> Casting spells: Through the mirror into the viewed scene is not possible. Stepping into the mirror: The caster may step into the divined scene:

> Portal: A faint, spatial distortion exists at the point at which the caster entered the scene. The portal is invisible, but may be perceived by the caster or by magic.

> Stepping back through: Anyone who perceives the portal may step out of the mirror and into the location whence the caster originated.

> At the end of the spell’s duration: The portal disappears. Any creature (including the caster) that stepped through the portal/mirror and did not return must save versus death or becomes lost in another plane of reality.

Material cost: The mirror must be of at least 5,000gp value
