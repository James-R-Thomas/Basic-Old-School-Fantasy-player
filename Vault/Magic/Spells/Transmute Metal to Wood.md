## Transmute Metal to Wood               

Duration: instantaneous

Range: 200’+20’/level

The spell affects a circular area with a diameter of 10’ per caster level. All metal objects within this area is changed to wood. This applies to all metal items, whether worn (including weapons and armor), laying around, used as building materials, or anywhere. Magic items made of metal may save vs. Spells to avoid the transmutation. Artifacts are not affected. Ordinary items (whether held or worn or not) do not get a saving throw.

Weapons converted from metal to wood take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The armor class of any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor class every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.

Only a wish can restore a transmuted object to its metallic state.
