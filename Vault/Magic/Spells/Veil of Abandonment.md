## Veil of Abandonment  

Duration: 1 turn per level

Range: 10’ per level

An area is cloaked with a combination of invisibility and illusion, making it seem vacant and neglected—covered in dust, cobwebs, and dirt, as if long abandoned.

> Creatures: In the affected area when the spell is cast are not cloaked.

> Inanimate objects: In the affected area are cloaked with invisibility and are veiled such that only direct contact will reveal their presence. Even then, an observer must make a saving throw versus spells to realise that the whole area is under the effects of an illusion: if the save fails, the observer believes that the detected object is merely invisible.

> Creatures passing through the area: Believe that their passing makes footprints in the dust, breaks through cobwebs, etc.

> Detection: Creatures that can detect invisible cannot see through this illusion.
