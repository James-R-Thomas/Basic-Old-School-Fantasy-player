## Wall of Thorns       

Duration: 1 turn per level

Range: 80’

A barrier of tough, thorny plants is conjured at a point of the caster’s choosing.

> Size: The wall can be any size up to 1,200 square feet and may be shaped in any manner and to any dimensions the caster desires. For example, it may be a straight wall or curved into a protective circle.

> Enveloping creatures: Any creatures standing in a spot where the wall is conjured suffer damage equal to 1d8 plus their AC score.

> Pushing through: Creatures may push through the wall, but suffer damage equal to 1d8 plus their AC score for every 10’.

> Ascending AC: If using the optional rule for Ascending Armor Class (see Ascending AC, p13), the damage inflicted by the thorns is 1d8 + (19 – AAC score).

> Hacking through the wall: Is possible and does not inflict damage on those breaking through. It takes 4 turns to chop through a 10’ section.

> Fire: The wall is unharmed by normal fire, but magical fire will burn it away completely in 2 turns.
