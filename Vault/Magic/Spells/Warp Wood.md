## Warp Wood       

Duration: Permanent

Range: 240’

Wooden objects of the caster’s choice warp and become useless.

> Common objects: One arrow-sized object is affected per level of the caster. A javelin, magic wand, or spear counts as two arrows; a bow, club, or staff counts as four.

> Objects of other shapes: (e.g. boards or planks) of roughly equivalent size may also be targeted.

Magical objects: That are targeted have a chance of being unaffected:

> Magic weapons and arms: Have a 10% chance of being unaffected per magical “plus”. (e.g. a magical spear +2 has a 20% chance of being unaffected by warp wood.)

> Wielding: If the magical object is in the hands of a creature, the creature may also save versus spells to prevent the object being warped.
