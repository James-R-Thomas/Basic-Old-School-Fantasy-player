This spell functions as phantasmal killer, except that it can have multiple targets. The spell can target as many creatures as desired as long as no two of them are further than 30 feet from each other.

Each target must save vs. Spells to disbelieve the phantasmal killer. If the saving throw is failed, the killer then touches the target, who must then save vs. Petrify or die from fear. Even if the target makes the second saving throw, they still take 3d6 points of damage.
