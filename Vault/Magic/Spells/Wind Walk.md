## Wind Walk                                                       

Duration: 1 hour/level

Range: touch

This spell alters the substance of the caster’s body to a cloud-like vapor (as the gaseous form spell) and he or she can move through the air, potentially at great speed. Other creatures can be touched by the caster, which causes them to be affected by the spell, too, each of whom acts independently. Up to one additional person per three caster levels my be included in the spell.

While under the spell, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet, able to move any direction at any time. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round, but maneuverability becomes very poor. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.

For the duration of the spell, each participant may freely switch between its physical form and its vaporous form as desired, but each change takes five rounds. The caster can dismiss the spell at any time, either individually or for everyone at once.

For the last minute of the spell’s duration, a wind walker in vaporous form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.
