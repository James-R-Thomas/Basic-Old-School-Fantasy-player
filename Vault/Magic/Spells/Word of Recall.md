## Word of Recall      

Duration: instantaneous

Range: self (special)

With the utterance of a single word this spell transports the caster to a place of refuge which they designate when preparing the spell.  The place must be Known Well (as explained for teleport) to the caster to be so designated.  This spell cannot transport the caster beyond their current plane of existence.

The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th.  The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).

Unwilling creatures cannot be transported by this spell, nor can items in their possession.  If the caster or one of their passengers is holding an object that is also being held by an unwilling creature, the latter can retain possession of the object with a successful save vs. Spells.
