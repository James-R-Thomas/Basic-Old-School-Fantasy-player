## Wraithform   

Duration: 1 turn

Range: The caster

The caster’s person—along with everything worn or carried—becomes shadowy and semi-incorporeal.

> Movement: The caster is able to pass through small holes and cracks.

> Actions: The caster may cast spells but may only attack incorporeal creatures.

> Invulnerability: Only magic and incorporeal creatures may harm the caster.

> Pass undead: Undead will ignore the caster, believing them to be a phantom of some kind. Undead of 10 or more HD may save versus spells (at a –4 penalty) to notice the illusion.

> Cancelling: The caster may end the spell at will, returning to normal.
