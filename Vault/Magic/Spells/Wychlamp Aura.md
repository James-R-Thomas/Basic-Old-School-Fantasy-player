## Wychlamp Aura                               

Duration: 1 turn/level

Range: self

The caster of this spell will be sheathed in a pale, glowing aura which confers the effect of an anti-magic shell (as the spell).  In addition, any magic cast upon or including the caster in its area of effect is affected as follows:

Spells directly targeting the caster (like magic missile) will be deflected.  Roll 1d6; on 1-2, the magic is reflected back at the offending caster.  Otherwise, it is deflected at a random target.

Magical attacks delivered by touch are always reflected back on the attacker.
